Use this extension to authenticate your users using passkeys within your firebsae project. Migrate existing users and sign up new users using the frictionless secure passwordless authentication.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a URL to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Shortens the URL.
- Saves the shortened URL in a new specified field in the same document.

If the original URL in a document is updated, then the shortened URL will be automatically updated, too.

This extension uses Bitly to shorten URLs, so you'll need to supply your Bitly access token as part of this extension's installation. You can generate this access token using [Bitly](https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps).
